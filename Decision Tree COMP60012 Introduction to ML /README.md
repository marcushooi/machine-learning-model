# COMP60012: Introduction to ML - Decision Tree Coursework
## About
This is a coursework for COMP60012: Introduction to ML that implements a decision tree algorithm and uses it to determine one of the indoor locations based on WIFI signal strengths collected from a mobile phone.

## Files
This repository contains the following files:
- [Decision_Tree.ipynb](https://github.com/Garrnesh/Intro-to-ML/blob/main/Decision_Tree.ipynb) contains the implementation of the algorithm for training desicion trees including the decision_tree_learning(dataset, depth) function as asked in the requirements.
- [clean_dataset.txt](https://github.com/Garrnesh/Intro-to-ML/blob/main/clean_dataset.txt) contains the clean dataset provided by the project spec.
- [noisy_dataset.txt](https://github.com/Garrnesh/Intro-to-ML/blob/main/noisy_dataset.txt) contains the noisy dataset provided by the project spec.
- [clean_decision_tree.png](https://github.com/Garrnesh/Intro-to-ML/blob/main/clean_decision_tree.png) image of a decision tree produced using the clean dataset.
- [noisy_decision_tree.png](https://github.com/Garrnesh/Intro-to-ML/blob/main/noisy_decision_tree.png) image of a decision tree produced using the noisy dataset.
- [COMP60012_Coursework_1_Report.pdf](https://github.com/Garrnesh/Introduction-to-Machine-Learning-Coursework-1-Decision-Trees/blob/main/COMP60012_Coursework_1_Report.pdf) is the report for the coursework, explaining the results.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository
```
https://github.com/Garrnesh/Intro-to-ML.git
```
## Running Instructions
As per the spec sheet, we assume that the machine is installed with **Numpy**, **Matplotlib** and **Standard Python Libraries**
1. Open `Decision_Tree.ipynb`
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook, to achieve the results.
3. If the lab computers do not have the required extensions installed, Visual Studio Code will auto-prompt for the installation of these     
extensions. These extensions include: Jupyter, Python
4. Ensure that the python environment is applied to the code before running the file
