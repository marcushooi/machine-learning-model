### Machine Learning Models Repository
------------
#### Overview 
This repository contains the machine learning projects that i have completed at Imperial College London during my Senior year. It includes selected corusework from the Masters of Computing.

It contain work from both Deep Learning and Introduction to Machine Learning

------------
#### Overview of Models
##### Deep Convolutional Generative adversarial network (DCGAN)
1. I designed the arcitecture of a simple generation 1 GAN that outputs a 32x32px image, that conducts unsupervised learning modelled after the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. I designed the models using various convolution transpose layers with LeakyRelu and Dropouts.
3. I modified the LR, Schedulers, BatchSizee and Epoch to train the model.

##### Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
1. I created a Variational Autoencoder to generate handwritten numbers based on the MINST dataset.

##### Convolution Network

##### Binary Tree
