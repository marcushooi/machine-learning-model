#### Deep Convolutional Generative adversarial network (DCGAN)

1. I designed the architecture of a simple generation 1 GAN that outputs a 32x32px image, that conducts unsupervised learning modelled after the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. I designed the models using various convolution transpose layers with LeakyRelu and Dropouts.
3. I modified the LR, Schedulers, BatchSizee and Epoch to train the model.

#### Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
1. Created a Variational Autoencoder to generate black and white handwritten numbers from 0 to 10 based on the MINST dataset.
